**<--This is the Intro of my APP**

"Voice Assistant App with ChatGPT & Dall-E "is an exciting app that combines the power of AI to make your chats more interesting. You can chat, create images, and even have responses read to you. Plus, your chat history is safe, and we've got you covered if you forget your password. We've implemented a secure Firestore database and seamlessly integrated two powerful APIs - OpenAI for text and DALL-E for image generation. And the best part? We've crafted this app using Flutter, making it a seamless and user-friendly experience. It's your new way to chat and get creative with AI!

**<--Minimum 3 navigatable pages**

The application is composed of four distinct pages: the Authentication Page, Home Page, Chat Page, and Settings Page. Additionally, the app offers both dark and light themes for user customization.

**<--API call implementation is must**

1)Firebase APIs:
a)FirebaseAuth: This API is used for authentication and user management within your application.
b)Cloud Firestore: This API is utilized for storing and managing your application's data in a NoSQL database hosted on Firebase.
2)OpenAI APIs:
a)ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo: This API, powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo, is integrated into your application for generating human-like text responses. It enables interactive and dynamic conversation capabilities.
b)Dall-E: This API, likely referring to OpenAI's DALL-E, is used for generating images from textual descriptions. Please note that you've mentioned the API key for these services is stored in Firebase for secure access.

This project utilizes Firebase APIs for authentication and data management, and OpenAI APIs, including ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo for text-based interactions and DALL-E for generating images from textual descriptions. The API keys for these services are securely stored in Firebase.
